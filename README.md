bluespree
=========

Blue Spree is a skin for the Jplayer Playlist javasctipt library. The name comes from the Spree brand candy, because the play button looks kind of like a blue piece of candy. Anyway, it comes with CSS and graphics to make Jplayer Playlist fit the theme I wanted. A layered PSD will be included for those who want to change it to red or green or whatever, so take it and run with it.
